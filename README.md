# Machine-Learning-Academic-Projects
Money laundering classification using Machine Learning.
This projects are all about identifying the fraud transection from financial datasets.
In this projects our primary objective is to develop a machine learning model which can identify the fraud transection. 
In this project we have 11 variables and approximate 6.3 million records of data. 
In this data sets there are 8312 records of fraud transections of our of 6.3 million data sets which is approx 0.1% so we can say it is highly imbalanced dataset.
